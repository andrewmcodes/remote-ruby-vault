## Summary

Andrew pulled a Tony Hawk, fell off his skateboard, and fractured his arm, so now he’s in a cast! But it’s all good because we are excited to have Andrea Fomera, Product Developer at Podia, as our guest. Today, she is here to talk Ruby with us and since she is the resident “Caddy Expert” at Podia, we decided to have her on to tell us all about Caddy and her Hotwire course. We also have a discussion on what NGINX and Passenger do, and there’s been some rumbling about “Rails Rumble” making a comeback which would be awesome!! Also, Chris makes an announcement about the launch of the Hotwire iOS template for Jumpstart Pro!

## Description

[00:00:49] What an interesting week for Andrew! Find out exactly what happened to him and all about his “concerns” he had at work.
[00:07:41] Chris was on Twitter this week talking about maybe bringing back “Rails Rumble” and he would love to make it happen but would need help.
[00:12:20] We find out if anyone has participated in a Hackathon before. Chris and Jason talk about one time they tried to have their own Hackathon and what happened.
[00:18:27] Andrea, the “Caddy Expert,” tells us all about Caddy and how Caddy 2 has the built in API.
[00:22:21] Andrea talks about a “proof of concept” she put together instead of using an API.
[00:24:53] Andrew wonders if Caddy is just a replacement for NGINX and Chris explains. He also mentions that Caddy is like NGNIX on steroids. ☺
[00:28:53] Chris tells us what Passenger does, and Andrea shares something about Passenger.
[00:31:50] We learn more about Andrea’s Hotwire course, and she shares her opinions on good case uses for Hotwire or StimulusReflex.
[00:37:35] Andrea tells us the biggest confusion with a lot of people who have gone through her course.
[00:38:39] Andrea announces there is a link to her course as well as Jason’s course, and you should check them both out. Andrea also announces she is giving a 15% discount on her course for Remote Ruby listeners! ☺
[00:39:08] We end with Chris announcing the launch of the Hotwire iOS template for Jumpstart Pro, which is going to be pretty sweet.
