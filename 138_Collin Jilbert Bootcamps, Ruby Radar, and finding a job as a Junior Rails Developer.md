## Summary

With Chris and Andrew both having “blah” weeks they wanted to bring on a guest this week. Today, we are excited to have on Collin Jilbert, Software Engineer at IMPACT. Collin is here to talk about being a Junior Rails Engineer, his journey, Bootcamps, and doing Ruby Radar with Andrew. He shares some honest advice about being a successful new developer, which includes to keep digging, keep researching things, digging deeper to grow, educating yourself, and sharing what you’ve learned. Also, find out more about Ruby Radar from Andrew and Collin and what you need to do to be one of their next Junior Spotlights.

## Description

[00:01:46] Collin gives us his background and getting into the programming world.

[00:26:42] When Bootcamp is nearing the end, Collin talks about how they connect you with a career coach to help you get a job. Also, finding a Junior Rails job is so rare to find now and he tells us how he approached it.
