## Description

[00:06:10] Jason starts out by talking about working on action cable this past weekend since he uses stimulus reflex for everything in life and he couldn’t control the logging. Chris mentions he had a similar issue happen to him.
[00:10:00] Andrew chimes in to say he thinks this is a place where components can really shine with cable ready. Jason talks about using components at work.
[00:13:19] Chris wonders if Jason has dropped down into Cable Ready since he’s been using Stimulus Reflex a lot. Chris finds it far more effective than Stimulus Reflex for what he has to do.
[00:18:51] Jason brings up offline and using it with Trix and he feels like he’s having to break rules to get it to work with Trix. Cursor positioning issues are talked about here.
[00:21:56] The guys chat about using halt so actions don’t re-render. Andrew reads the docs and lets us know what it says about halts
[00:25:19] Jason talks about the really cool and foundational pieces is the JavaScript Callbacks and he explains why. He also tells us about something he did for fun with rewriting messaging in Reflex.
[00:33:32] Chris brings up the scroll stuff and how that gets to the edge of trickiness with Stimulus Reflex for chat. He wonders if you want to scroll back in history how do you keep track of it and render it? Andrew shares something with Chris he has in their code base that may help.
[00:37:35] Staying on the topic of Reflex, Jason mentions shipping out through Podia, a Stimulus Reflex testing library called, “Stimulus Reflex Testing” and he couldn’t find any test helpers or any testing story for reflex right now.
[00:42:00] Jason mentions a problem he’s had with reflex creating a request, like a dummy request in order for it to re-render. He explains what happens and what he tries to do to make it work out.
[00:46:47] Andrew explains why there is no amazing testing support in Reflex and he also has a few suggestions for Jason that he could try.
[00:49:57] Andrew asks the guys if they’ve enabled the new design on GitHub yet and he tells them how to do it.
