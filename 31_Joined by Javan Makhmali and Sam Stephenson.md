## Summary

Buckle up! In this episode, Javan Makhmali and Sam Stephenson join Jason and Chris. Sam and Javan are employees at Basecamp and also part of the mastermind behind many JavaScript libraries to come out of Basecamp: Turbolinks, Trix, and Stimulus. They each share how they got started programming, a brief insight into how they work at Basecamp, the transition from CoffeeScript to ES6, Typescript, as well as (wait for it...) upcoming features in Stimulus (ðŸ™Œ) and considerations for Turbolinks 6 (no feature promises made ðŸ˜‰).

It was an absolute joy to chat with Javan and Sam. We very much enjoyed this episode and hope you will enjoy it, too.
