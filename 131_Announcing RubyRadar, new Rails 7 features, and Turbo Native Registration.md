## Summary

Andrew is finally back and has stories to tell about what happened before his move, finding a place to live during a housing shortage, and what happened on his first IKEA experience! Now that he’s somewhat settled in, he catches up with Chris on what’s happening in Ruby on Rails land, which starts off with a story about a man’s submarine that is running Ruby. Also, we learn about an RSS reader called Inoreader, a newsletter Andrew is doing with Collin Jilbert called Ruby Radar, the improvements with Rails 7, and using Crystal and Lucky. Chris tells us he merged Turbo Native registration into Jumpstart and the Swift iOS app, and RubyConf 2021 is happening in-person this year!
