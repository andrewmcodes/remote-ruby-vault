## Summary

Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us! We are LIVE from Denver at RubyConf 2021 with a big podcast crossover episode. Today, we have Jemma Issroff who is one of the co-hosts of the Ruby on Rails podcast and is moderating this panel. We have three other podcasts represented here across five panelists from Remote Ruby Podcast, The Code with Jason Podcast, and The Ruby on Rails Podcast. Joining us from those podcasts are Andrew Mason, Jason Charnes, Emily Giurleo, Nick Schwaderer, and Jason Swett. Today, we have discussions about the RubyConf talks, which ones everyone is most excited to go to, and what is so special about the Ruby community to each panelist. Then the conversation shifts to finding out why they like to come to these conferences, why they like to do podcasts, which podcasts they are most proud of putting out, thoughts on the diversity of people they bring on their podcasts, and stories about why everyone loves Brittany Martin! There are some questions from the live audience such as how they come up with interesting content for their podcasts, who their “Ruby Heroes” are, and how they avoid burnout from consistently producing episodes. This is a must listen to episode, so go ahead and download it now!
