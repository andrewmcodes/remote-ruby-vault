## Summary

In this episode, we chat with Jacob Herrington. Jacob is a Senior Developer at Engine, host of the devpath.fm podcast, and a maintainer of the Solidus platform. What didn't we talk about? We talk about Jacob's discovery of programming, how he got his first few jobs, how he found his way to the Solidus core team, the dreaded conversation of imposter syndrome, and podcasting.
