## Summary

On today’s episode, the guys start off telling us how they all had a very rough, eventful week that let’s just say, involved an architect, the police, and repos and data lost. Then, they dive right into Jason telling us how he completed his testing videos for his StimulusReflex course but has hit a weird spot with the app being a little incomplete. Chris talks about the OmniAuth 2.0 course being out now and how he saved and resurrected madmin. We also learn about the 12 in 12 project that was released this week, Andrew trying to clean up projects, tying up loose ends, and how his GitHub is a mess. Will Andrew delete his GitHub? Will Andrew still be a programmer? Will Andrew’s sanity stay intact? Find out next week, same time, same podcast.
