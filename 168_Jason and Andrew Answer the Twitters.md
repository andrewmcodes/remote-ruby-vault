## Summary

Jason and Andrew are in the house today, and instead of Remote Ruby they’re doing Remote Twitter. They’re going to talk about all different topics that people have requested on Twitter. The guys are super excited to dive into this especially since some of the things they may not know anything about, but they’re going to attempt every single thing that was sent to them. You won’t want to miss Jason as he busts out his theatrical skills with a dramatic reading of Haml(et), we hear a little bit of singing of “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie, and the story behind why Jason bought Andrew lobster.
