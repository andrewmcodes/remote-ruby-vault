## Summary

In this episode, Jason and Chris chat with Lee Richmond. Lee is a Ruby on Rails developer at Bloomberg as well as the maintainer of the Graphiti project. Graphiti makes RESTful Resources a first-class concept. The three discuss the motivation behind Graphiti, how it compares to GraphQL, and some of the neat tools Graphiti comes with, such as Vandal and Spraypaint.
