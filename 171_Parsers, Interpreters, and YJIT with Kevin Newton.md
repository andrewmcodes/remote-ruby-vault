## Summary

Just in case you always wanted to know what a day in the life of Andrew Mason is like, from his early wake up, his hygiene, his favorite shows, and what time he goes to bed, then you’re in for a real treat because you will find out all of this and more. And if that’s not enough, we also have a great guest joining us, Kevin Newton, who is the Staff Production Engineer at Shopify and has been doing Ruby for about ten years now. Kevin and the guys have some fantastic conversations about compilers and by the end of this episode, hopefully it will alleviate any of the anxiety you may have felt about them because it truly is some fun stuff. Jason said he feels less intimidated than he did just listening to everything Kevin talks about. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more!
