- [Nate Berkopec: "Part of the reason I continue to invest in Ruby is that no one ever says "I stopped using Ruby because it wasn't very productive/expressive/fun". No one is switching to <insert meme language of the moment here> because it's "more" of one of those things."](https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1219999519544205313?s=20)
