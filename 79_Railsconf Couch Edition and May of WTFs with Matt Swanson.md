## Summary

Welcome to Remote Ruby! What’s been going on this week? Chris has been playing with CableReady and Jason started using Reflex at work. On today’s episode, we have a special guest, Matt Swanson, a Software Engineer, based in Indianapolis, who works at a consulting agency called SEP. Matt talks about doing Rails at work and other things he does, like his blog, “Boring Rails.” The guys all discuss their favorite “RailsConf 2020.2 Couch Edition” talks that they’ve watched so far, and there have been quite a few really good ones, especially the one by our very own, Chris Oliver! ☺ Also, Rails WTF’s and Spring are discussed as well. Loads of good information here, especially if you want to find out more about all the talks at RailsConf 2020.2 Couch Edition.

## Description

[00:04:25] Matt gives us an introduction of who he is and what he does at SEP. He also mentions his blog called, “Boring Rails.” (don’t be fooled by the name)☺
[00:05:55] Besides doing Rails at work, Matt fills us in on other things he works in.
[00:08:08] Jason asks the guys if any of them have watched the “RailsConf 2020.2 Couch Edition” talks and what are some of their favorites. Andrew starts off talking about a Webpacker one called, “Webpacker, It-just-works, But How?’ by Justin Gordon. Also, “Tidy First?” by Kent Beck. Matt mentions that DHH had an interesting one, which was more of a Q&A, “Keynote Interview,” by David Heinemeier Hansson.
[00:10:50] Chris mentions everyone checking out DHH’s series on YouTube called, “Writing Software Well.” It convinced Chris to take a look at concerns more.
[00:17:10] Another great video from RailsConf 2020 that Andrew talks about is the Engines video by Vladimir Dementyev called, “Monoliths Between Microservices.”
[00:21:03] Matt liked a talk on “Bug Bounty” by Jason Meller, from Kolide which was a good mix of the UX and Dev side and evaluating security issues. He also mentions something about “pseudo mode” you may be interested in.
[00:26:54] Andrew tells us three more talks he enjoyed: “Successfully Onboarding a Junior Engineer in Three Steps,” with Emily Giurleo, “Building a Performance Analytics Tool with Active Support,” with Christian Bruckmeyer, and “Encapsulating Views,” with Joel Hawksley.
[00:31:09] Andrew talks about not using validations and instead using a render method and Jason tells him that feature came out of Podia and explains.
[00:31:53] Jason brings up how they have an entire thread of “Rails WTF's” that came about from some Tweets from Advi. Andrew chimes in with a shout-out to Betsy Haibel, who’s doing an amazing job of being one of the moderators, asking questions and helping people clear up things.
[00:38:18] Chris brings up “Spring” and some of its frustrations.
[00:41:28] Chris brings up the topic of GitHub’s “no search and rails guides” and he explains what happened here. Matt brings up some good points here as well.
