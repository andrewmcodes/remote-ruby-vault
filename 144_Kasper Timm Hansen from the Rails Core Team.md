## Summary

ason and Chris chat about what was going on in their world with Jason having issues with specs, and it’s all around Stripe, and Chris was in a similar boat with his PR for Pay. This week’s guest is Kasper Timm Hansen from the Rails Core Team. Today, he’s going to tell us what he’s doing and how he got into doing Ruby and Rails. Kasper’s been doing some pull requests reviews and other things on Twitter and we find out other things he’s been up to. He talks about feature flags, shaping things, and one of the things he likes to do in terms of modeling things in a Rails app. We also learn why Kasper enjoys Ruby more than Python, his focus on the naming of things, which is more problem sizing and not so much about problem solving, and how he feels open source has changed in the last five years. Also, Chris shares a story when he was in college and had a very clear moment knowing he was going to do Rails forever.

## Description

[00:00:43] Jason and Chris chat about stripe-ruby-mock and Paddle.
[00:03:23] Kasper tells about himself, what he’s doing now, and how he got into the Rails and Ruby stuff.
[00:13:51] Chris asks Kasper if he has any thoughts on the depth that he has to put into thinking about every one of the PR’s which has to be quite a lot.
[00:15:06] Chris brings up Active Storage as an interesting example that was a basecamp use case that was extracted, and Kasper shares some thoughts on this too.
[00:17:12] Something Chris brings up is Kasper’s been doing some pull request reviews and stuff publicly on Twitter, and he brings up a thread he noticed there is very close attention to detail in naming things, and he wonders if Kasper puts a lot of thought into shaping of how it reads and guides you in the right direction to think about features and stuff.
[00:23:09] Chris brings up something that caught his eye recently when he designed Pay to add payment details, and he noticed Active Storage took a different approach with migrations and he explains.
[00:27:03] Kasper explains more of what he focuses on with the naming thing and how it’s not so much about the “problem solving” aspect of it but more of the “problem sizing” of it.
[00:29:03] Find out if Kasper’s done much on the mobile side of Hotwire and fiddled with iOS or Android, and he tells us what he’s been doing besides pull requests on Twitter.
[00:40:30] Chris shares a story when he had a very clear moment in college knowing he was going to do Rails forever.
[00:43:38] Kasper talks about commits and mentions somebody should make a “commit farming bot” which sounds perfect for Andrew! ☺ Also, if you’re new to Rails and you’re reading the docs and they don’t make sense or they’re not working, find out why you should dive in.
[00:47:52] Find out where you can follow Kasper online.
