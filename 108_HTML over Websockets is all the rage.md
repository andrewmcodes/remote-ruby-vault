## Summary

Jason and Chris are here today, and they start off with talking about a busy Black Friday weekend. In the Ruby on Rails world, Rails 6.1 RC2 is out, and there’s been some buzz on Twitter with DHH about some new magic happening with it. Chris tells us about the new updates with Stimulus 2.0 and how job queues play into WebSockets. Chris has been working on a custom process support for Hatchbox and he built his own version of CableReady to use, and Jason tells us why CableReady just keeps getting better. Also, Chris tells us all about the Ruby Advent Calendar that you should check out.
