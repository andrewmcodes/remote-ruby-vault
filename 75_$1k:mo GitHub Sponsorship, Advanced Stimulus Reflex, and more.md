## Summary

Welcome to Remote Ruby! This week we have Chris and Andrew who will fill you in on some cool things. The guys start off talking about Active Admin. They also talk about a web framework called, Lucky. Also, Chris has some exciting news to share about getting a new GitHub sponsor which was the highlight of his week! Have you heard of Optimism or CableReady? Lambda or Proc? Listen to this episode to find out more.

## Description

[00:03:35] Chris talks about “Active Admin,” which is the most popular Rails Admin Gem and how useful it is to use.
[00:07:25] Andrew brings up “Lucky,” a Crystal database wrapper, and Chris gives his opinion about it.
[00:11:47] Chris and Andrew mention using GitLab, but both prefer GitHub until things get fixed. And with teams going free mostly, it will be nice for discussions and paid projects like Jumpstart or Tailwind UI.
[00:14:28] Chris shares some exciting news about getting a new GitHub sponsor! Cha-Ching! Let’s just say it was the highlight of his week!! ☺
[00:19:26] Optimism, which is a Gem to do form type things, is mentioned here. Also, Chris brings up a question on if anyone has done this on Stimulus Reflex, where someone takes an action, but it would broadcast the update to everybody. Is this easily doable? Andrew answers this.
[00:24:03]] Andrew talks about using Typescript and Chris talks about wanting to explore into CableReady. There is also talk with a breaking change in Stimulus Reflex that just recently happened.
[00:29:49] Chris asks Andrew if he has a source repo where he keeps his GitHub pull request templates.
[00:32:50] In talking about docs, Andrew recommends “Read the Docs” and Chris uses “GitBook” for Hatchbox docs and they discuss in depth about it.
[00:41:09] Chris talks about how we need a new way of people maintaining things to get stuff done, like a changing of the guards. But he hopes there will still be good maintainers as things go on. Andrew has been thinking about that a lot too and he shares his thoughts.
[00:43:10] Chris explains a Lambda and a Proc and the difference between them.
[00:49:46] Andrew asks Chris when he is passing parameters to a method, does he name them, or does he just pass them all in? Andrew explains.
[00:57:07] Andrew and Chris talk about using Binstubs and Annotate.
