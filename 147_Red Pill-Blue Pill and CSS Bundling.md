Some exciting things going on this week for the guys! Andrew hit some baseball games last weekend and became a bandwagon fan, Chris got to fly his drone and watched the crane putting up the trusses on his house, and Jason’s working on a side project and he’s using ImageMagick. Some other interesting things discussed today are the CSS bundling stuff that’s been going on, RubyConf 2021 coming up and if it still going to be an in-person event, and Chris tells us about an online talk he’s doing for Sardines.rb you should check out.
