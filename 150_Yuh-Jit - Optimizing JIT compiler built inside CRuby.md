## Summary

Chris was all set to finally have his wedding ceremony, but he and his wife got COVID! They’re both feeling better, but the festivities will have to be rescheduled yet again. We’ll keep the good times rollin’ here today and we find out if the guys have done anything with Rails 7 yet. Jason tells us about using Lockbox and Symmetric Encryption, and we learn more about Ruby 3.1 and the new project from Shopify called YJIT. The guys also chat more TenderJit, “dnssd gem,” Rubyist 1.0 App, and DragonRuby. Also, Andrew makes an announcement that Ruby Radar is giving out free tickets to RubyConf 2021 so go check it out!
