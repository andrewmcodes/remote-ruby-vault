## Summary

Andrew is celebrating his birthday, Chris can’t wait until he can go back to a RailsConf in person one day, and Jason really wants to hang out with people. For now, we will just have to keep things virtual, like RailsConf 2021 which will be happening in April, and Chris tells us about a talk he submitted to it. Andrew fills us in about a virtual talk at a meetup he’s giving in June, which he will be advocating for junior dev’s since it’s so important to him. Other topics discussed are Turbo, putting Turbo into React Native, using Turbo to build a PWA, htmx, how awesome TypeScript is, and the importance of writing better Ruby. Also, who knew there were different versions of JSON?
