## Summary

Today, it’s just the three of us, we’re going to make it and we’re going to try, especially since Andrew needs his meds refilled and can’t seem to get them since he’s moved to Phoenix. But hey, we’re going to get Andrew’s mind off of that and talk about how it was a big week for JavaScript in Rails. Jason starts us out by explaining a JavaScript tool he’s been building, using Vite, a problem he had, and a solution he found. Then, the guys chat more about esbuild for Rails, Tailwind CSS Rails gem, Importmap for Rails, and Sass being removed from Rails 7. If you’re in the mood for some good ol’ laughs today, this is the episode to listen to! Also, find out why Andrew said, “Once you get it working it works!” ☺

## Description

[00:03:52] Jason fills us in on how he’s building a pretty heavy JavaScript tool, using Vite, and a problem he had.
[00:11:04] We learn about some PR’s Jason around Webpacker on the GoRails discord that had a solution for Jason’s problem.
[00:13:50] Chris talks about “esbuild for Rails” and other approaches that are coming out right now with DHH’s latest stuff is fascinating. He also talks about Babel being a nightmare and being able to do the Importmap Rails for Turbo and Stimulus that have hardly any dependencies is fantastic.
[00:16:59] Chris wonders if the guys think it makes sense that esbuild Rails spits out the final file in the asset pipeline and an esbuild folder under assets, because those should be just .JS files, and if that’s just going to be serving up basically Sprockets.
[00:21:54] Tailwind CSS Rails gem is explained by Chris as to why it was written, and Andrew brings up about how Docker is going to start charging.
[00:23:28] Chris goes into how classes are finally being fully supported which makes a big difference for organizing stuff and how it makes us appreciate what we’ve got with bundler and how good it’s organized. Find out what he says about gems too.
[00:25:15] Andrew asks the guys if they have set who their GitHub repos will be given to in the event of their untimely demise.
[00:25:50] Jason is looking through the esbuild source code and tells us there’s not much, which is super nice, and Andrew shares his BOLD advice.
[00:27:25] The topic discussed here is putting Tailwind into esbuild and what to do, and Chris announces that Sass is being removed from Rails 7.
[00:30:22] Andrew asks the guys how they felt when Sass was removed since they are “old” and wrote more Sass than Andrew ever did.
[00:34:05] Listen to the end if you’re in need for some good babble and laughs with the guys! ☺
