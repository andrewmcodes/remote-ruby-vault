## Summary

Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us! First, let us preface that whatever you hear in this episode, Andrew did NOT steal an iPad! Also, Andrew is rallying the valley with his Suns jersey and Jason is triggered by this since he’s a Grizzlies fan, as well as Chris, and there was talk about minting some Remote Ruby NFTs. Some other things the guys talk about is the incident that happened with Heroku and GitHub, SIM swapping, iPad stealing, and some really great security tools you should be using to monitor your code base and protect yourself. And the guys do some shout-outs to people that left reviews on their podcast and they talk about RailsConf 2022 coming up. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more!
