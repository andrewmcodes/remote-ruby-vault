## Summary

Welcome to Remote Ruby and thanks for joining us! We are Chris-less today, but thankfully we have a guest joining us. On this episode, we are chatting with Adam McCrea, who is a Ruby Developer, and the Founder and Developer of a Heroku add-on called Rails Autoscale. You are in the right place if you want to learn more about Rails Autoscale because Adam shares everything it does, the problem it solves, and when you should start using it. Also, he tells us about a new autoscaler he’s working on that’s going to be language-agnostic on Heroku, more about the Rails app YNAB, and what he’s most excited about that’s happening in the Ruby community. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out much more!
