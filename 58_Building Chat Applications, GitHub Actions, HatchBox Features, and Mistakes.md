## Summary

In this pre-Thanksgiving episode released post-Thanksgiving, we talk about what it was like working with ActionCable and React on Podia's latest feature, messaging. We also talk through GitHub actions, some of the features of HatchBox (including using DigitalOcean Spaces as a drop-in S3 replacement), and a plethora of mistakes I (Jason) have made over the last two weeks. Best yet, we cram it into forty minutes.
