## Summary

Chris and Jason are in the house today and they will be spending the whole episode talking about their love for ERB since Andrew is not here. JK! Jason finally gets to check this off his to-do list and talk about modelling friendships in your database. Chris tells us about watching a RailsCast episode by Ryan Bates, Tweets that Ryan made recently, and Jason brags on something Chris did for Ryan. Other topics they dive into are Acts As Tenant gem, a card game Jason built in Rails, what Jason did with a Stimulus Reflex Course, and a Tailwind Stimulus Components library Chris built. Also, Tailwind CSS v2.0 was released, and find out what Chris wrote that he may be turning into a Screencast very soon!
