## Summary

In this episode, we chat with Jonathan Reinink. According to his website, Jonathan is active in the open-source community, particularly within the PHP and Laravel space. We'd argue Jonathan is also very active in the CSS and JS open-source community, as well. Jonathan co-authored TailwindCSS and authored Inertia.js. We talk with Jonathan about how he helped get TailwindCSS off the ground and dig deep into Inertia.js. Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.
