## Summary

Today we have a special guest, Will Johnson, self-taught developer, works for Egghead, and wrote an E-Book called, Break Into Tech With Twitter. Will is here today to tell us what it’s like to learn Rails. He has a great inspirational story he shares on how he got into being a Rails Developer, what he does at Egghead, what he’s doing to keep up on his learning around Rails, and things that worked for him when he first started out learning about Ruby. Chris and Jason also share some great resources for beginners.

## Description

[00:00:25] What have the guys been up to? Jason tells us he’s been working on his editor project with Reflex and Cable Ready, Chris has been working on Stimulus Reflex, and Andrew’s project is trying to truncate a table that has 225 million records in it! Yikes! Fingers crossed for Andrew!
[00:07:20] Will tells us all about himself and how he got into Rails.
[00:09:02] Will gives us a synopsis of his E-book, _Break \_Into_ Tech With Twitter, \_that was released a few weeks ago.
[00:10:21] Andrew asks Will, as a newer developer, what it’s like transitioning from JavaScript into Ruby on Rails.
[00:12:40] Chris wonders if going from JavaScript with all the call backs into Ruby if it was hard for Will to wrap his head around the way the language operates differently.
[00:15:12] Jason asks Will if his experience with JavaScript was front end or backend. Also, how difficult was it knowing JavaScript, which is a programming language for the front end, and then trying to apply the concepts to serve -side programming.
[00:16:26] Will tells us his super cool and inspirational story of his background. Also, he tells us about his current job at Egghead and if he thinks he will be there for a long time.
[00:32:21] Andrew asks Will what he’s doing to keep up on his learning around Rails.
[00:34:16] Chris and Jason share some great resources for beginners.
[00:36:27] Will shares some things that he found that worked for him when he first started out, in terms of learning more about Ruby. He talks about how he didn’t get models.
[00:43:48] Will tells us where we can find him online.
