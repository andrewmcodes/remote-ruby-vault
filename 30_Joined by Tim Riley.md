## Summary

In this episode, Tim Riley joins Jason and Chris. Tim, a partner at Icelab, dry-rb core team member, and world-renowned speaker (at least in Jason's eyes) shares how he got started programming with Ruby, the dry-rb project, Hanami 2.0, dry-view, and public speaking.

/me breaks third person tone: I had the honor of having Tim join us at the first Southeast Ruby (2017) after watching a couple of his talks online. Tim is a fantastic person whom I'm glad to have as a friend. He brings a unique approach to writing Ruby that I find so fascinating. I hope you'll enjoy this episode as much as we did. - Jason
