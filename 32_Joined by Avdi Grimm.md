## Summary

In this episode, Jason and Chris chat with Avdi Grimm. Avdi, a well-known author, screencaster, and consultant shared how he got started in programming, how he subsequently started using Ruby, what he appreciates about Ruby, his transition into teaching, a brief section on object-oriented programming and functional programming, and public speaking. Avdi is a gem (no pun intended) in the Ruby community, and it was a thrill to have him on the show.
