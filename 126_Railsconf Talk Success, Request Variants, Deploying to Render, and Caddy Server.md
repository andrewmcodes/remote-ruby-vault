## Summary

It’s been a super busy week for the guys between work and personal stuff. Chris gives us an update on how RailsConf 2021 went last week, and Andrew shares some “moving” news and a secret dream of his. We learn in detail about Chris’s talk at RailsConf, which was on Action Text, Turbo, and ActionMailbox. Then, the guys chat about using Trix, Markdown Editor, Turbo Native, and Render. Also, find out more about Caddy 2 and how Chris built something with job boards using Caddy. In addition, we learn about a new version of Hatchbox coming out soon, opinions on how Heroku needs improvements, and if there’s any news with Rails 7.0 being released.
