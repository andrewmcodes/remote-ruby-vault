## Summary

Today, the gang’s all here!  So, what’s up with the guys this week? Well, Jason and Andrew are headed out of town for a Podia retreat, Chris has been fixing a bug this past week that he may have finally found a solution for but he’s not in the clear yet,  and if you listened to last week’s episode, Andrew clears the air and defines what “Posterized” means.
