## Summary

So, what’s “sup” with the guys this week? Jason and Andrew just can’t make themselves cry like actors do, but when Andrew was interviewing with Podia he sobbed when he found out the templating language they were using. Which brings us to our guest, Sebastien Auriault, who is very special to us and also won’t make us cry. Sebastien is a Ruby on Rails Developer at Podia and has been working on a project there with Jason and Andrew. We brought Sebastien on so he can talk about his developer origin story, which will be beneficial for those of you who are looking to get jobs who are in junior positions right now. Sebastien shares all kinds of advice and helpful information if you’re looking for a job and don’t know where to start. Also, if you leave a review on iTunes, DM Jason and the guys will personally thank you on the next episode.
