## Description

[00:01:13] DHH tells us what Hotwire is and what’s new in Rails.
[00:16:38] Jason brings up Hey being able to go full import map, and wonders if DHH sees being able to move to import maps only for Basecamp 4 eventually or will there be esbuild involved.
[00:25:51] Hotwire Strada comes into the conversation and DHH fills us in on this. Chris talks about how the CSS and JS bundling turned out so clean and simple.
[00:30:11] DHH shares his thoughts on building something in a simple, clear way versus taking the complex path. He also shares some info about Tailwind in Rails 7.

[00:51:00] Andrew asks DHH if there are any plans of restarting On Writing Software Well series on YouTube.
[00:57:08] We found out some things that have been added to Rails 7 that DHH is excited about that aren’t front-end.
[01:03:31] Chris brings up how he feels Rails has always been an entrepreneurial framework and DHH shares what he hopes they will eventually end up with devise.
[01:05:33] DHH talks about the no code days, why he’s so keen about how Rails works today, and why he’s so spirited about learning being a key value.
[01:13:11] Jason asks DHH what’s been the most favorite decisions he’s made in Rails that he’s most proud of.
[01:17:46] With Hotwire being shipped in Rails 7, find out what’s next for DHH.
[01:21:51] Andrew asks DHH how to choose between “action and active” when you’re naming these resources.
