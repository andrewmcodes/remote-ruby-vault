## Summary

Jason and Chris have ice, snow, and freezing temps where they live, and Andrew is complaining about being cold at 60 degrees in Arizona! Maybe he’ll warm up when he starts his new job at Podia with Jason this week. Also, if you enjoy Flipper like the guys do, then you’re in for a treat with our guest. Today, joining us is John Nunemaker, builder of Flipper, which is feature flags for Ruby, as well as the programmer and owner of Box Out Sports, which is a content management system for social media graphics. John goes in depth about Flipper, Box Out Sports, some Flipper rules stuff he’s working on, and the Ruby gem he recently wrote called “brow.” And hopefully you’re not too “short on time” because John tells us more about the fascinating watch app he’s building and shares stories of the history behind some of the cool watches he’s found. Go ahead and download this episode now to learn more!
