## Summary

Hello and welcome to Remote Ruby! Jason, Chris, and Andrew are back together and they have a lot to talk about. Notifications is the hot topic today. Also, the guys discuss GoodJob library, using Sidekick, Active Job and Active Delivery. Jason talks about being in an experimental research and development mode at Podia and changes they are making to their editor with Stimulus Reflex and Cable Ready. (Podia is hiring!) The guys make their predictions when Rails 6.1 will be released. Andrew finally got a new job! Have you heard of Ruby for Good?

## Description

[00:00:25] Chris has been tweeting about doing notifications in Rails and trying to build and he asks the guys if they’ve used any notifications gems in Rails or have they built it from scratch or what have they done in the past. Chris mentions about something Palkan wrote about Active Delivery.
[00:06:34] Chris talks about getting a Tweet from Steve Polito about writing Gems is a good way of pushing your learning.
[00:10:35] Jason tells us what notifications are to him, which is always a thing he wants to add but then he pushes it off. Chris mentions Laravel has notifications right out of the box and that was the inspiration for the approach he took.
[00:12:29] Jason wants to know if the guys saw the GoodJob Library and then he talks about using Sidekick and Active Job at his work.
[00:17:15] The last few weeks, Jason’s been in an experimental research and development mode and he’s been trying to improve and make changes to their editor at Podia which is like a live website editor. He explains what they are doing.
[00:25:18] Andrew asks Jason if they’re doing database queries from their components or if they’re passing that data, like injecting it in.
[00:28:46] Chris asks Jason if he has the chat and that and several other things using Action Cable now. Jason also mentions that he’s been doing a lot of reflex and that they’ve expanded reflex down to four or five parts of their application. Chris wants to know if it’s still been working out without having to move to Anycable yet.
[00:33:00] Jason tells us his company, [Podia, is hiring if you’re interested or you want to solve all the problems he’s mentioned](https://apply.workable.com/podia/j/6D4A20DE01/), and Andrew has landed a new job and he tells us where. Congratulations, Andrew! ☺
[00:39:36] Andrew touches on two more things, and asks the guys if they had to guess, when are we going to see Rails 6.1? They make their predictions. Also, he asks them if they know anything about Ruby for Good and he explains what it is.
