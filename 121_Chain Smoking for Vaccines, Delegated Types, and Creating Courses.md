## Summary

This week, Chris was almost running into an issue with the law, Jason is getting his COVID vaccine, and Andrew is chain smoking 100 cigarettes so he can get the COVID vaccine. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em boys! There is never a dull moment in the life of our “Gang of Rubyists!” Today, the guys discuss Delegated Types, steps to create an online training course, and what Chris’s RailConf 2021 talk is about.

## Description

[00:01:00] The guys chat about what happened this week in their lives, getting COVID vaccines, and Chris trying to get a title transferred on an old car.
[00:10:57] Andrew poses a question to Jason and Chris which has to do with Delegated Types. Chris and Jason have a discussion about using it.
[00:17:13] Chris mentions pagination being a problem and how querying and then merging could work. After having the discussion, Andrew says it all makes sense to him.
[00:22:14] Jason tells us about a pretty gnarly JSONB data migration he had to write this week.
[00:24:16] Chris tells us he got his RailsConf talk approved and what it’s about.
[00:26:19] Andrew asks the guys for advice on what their process is on building a course because he started to make a VS course for Rails and he’s trying to figure out a system. Is it a HAML course?
[00:32:46 Andrew asks Jason’s advice about the right time to register for Podia.
[00:38:21] Since Andrew is in the process of making his course, Jason tells Andrew since he’s a VS code user, he would love to see something tailored towards Ruby developers.
