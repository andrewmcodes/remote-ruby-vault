## Summary

Joining us on today’s episode, we have Joel Hawksley, an Engineer at GitHub and creator of ViewComponent. We learn what ViewComponents are, how Joel came up with the idea, and his latest experiment and vision for it, which is a big one. Joel tells us some ideas he has for Cuprite, and Andrew talks about how Percy is a nice tool to use. Also, for those of you who haven’t used the components library or maybe haven’t started thinking about building Rails apps in terms of components, Joel is here to help answer some questions Andrew has for him.
