## Summary

Jason and Andrew are here today without Chris since he got married and is on his honeymoon! Today, the guys share some great self-care ramblings and talk about Ruby things too! They discuss Andrew’s wrist problems, how they are handling stress these days, and how their diets have changed for the better. Andrew even discovers a kitchen tool, that is actually not a weapon after all, to help with his new cooking skills! Other topics discussed are a Laravel package called Scout, the release of Ruby 3.0.0, Sorbet, a Gem called Steep, why RBS is cool, and using Solargraph in VS code. Also, find out why Andrew likes using TypeScript.
