## Summary

Jason either has a gout flare up or carpal tunnel, so he’s contemplating if he should get an ergonomic keyboard and an ergonomic mouse since one of them is the culprit of his pain. What should this boomer do? For now, we’ll just have to wait to see what happens and get into chatting with our guest. Today, we have joining us Andreas Eriksson, who is an Elixir Consultant for Erlang Solutions. We brought him on so we can chat about Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, and other things, since we’ve all been fascinated with wanting to learn more about this stuff. We also find out about Andreas experience going from Ruby to Elixir, and what attracted him to the Elixir language after writing Ruby code for more than ten years.

## Description

[00:03:47] Andreas gives us a brief introduction of who he is, what he does, and how long he’s been writing Ruby code and Elixir code.
[00:05:59] Find out what Phoenix LiveView is, and Jason wonders if it’s something that multiple processes could come in and reference or if it’s tied to one kind of connection.
[00:08:55] Jason asks Andreas if he’s building a web app and someone tells him to use LiveView, what type of problems is he solving by using LiveView?
[00:10:17] Since there’s a way to get the raw JavaScript events with LiveView, Andrew wonders if that means you can make your own custom events too or if just responds to the built-in JavaScript events.
[00:11:48] Jason talks about what interests him the most about LiveView and how magical it is.
[00:13:24] When LiveView came out, Andreas replaced React Components and he explains what those components were doing and how he was able to replace that functionality. He also explains how the React implementation and LiveView implementations differ.
[00:16:20] Andrew wonders if there are any things Andreas tried to move into LiveView that he’s been unsuccessful with or if there’s a specific group of things that LiveView isn’t that great at handling.
[00:17:17] Jason brings up the approach of making the entire layout live and asks Andreas if memory usage is ever a worry there.
[00:19:21] We learn what kind of work Andreas does for Erlang Solutions, and what attracts him the Elixir language coming from a Ruby language.
[00:23:01] Andreas tells us about his experience moving from Ruby to Elixir, his path to learning Elixir, and things he recommends if you’re interested in doing this.
[00:26:47] Find out where you can follow Andreas on the internet.
