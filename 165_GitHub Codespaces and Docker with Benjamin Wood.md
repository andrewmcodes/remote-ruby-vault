## Summary

We start off with Andrew inadvertently screwing up a sweet joke from The Office that Jason was trying to set up. But before the banter begins, Andrew announces after two years he’s finally shipped his website that you have to check out! Also, today joining us as our guest is Benjamin Wood, who is a Software Developer and owns a software consulting company called Hint that he co-founded. He’s been doing things with Docker for several years which we learn more about, and he’ll explain more on the new service that GitHub created called Codespaces, which is heavily Docker based. Some other discussions the guys have revolve around the state of VSCode in Ruby Extension, Vim, and the ongoing conversation that keeps coming up about the VSCode app on the iPad.
