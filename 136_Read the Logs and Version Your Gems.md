## Summary

We are so excited to have Jason back today! Since the guys haven’t all been together in a few weeks, they start with catching up on what’s been going on in their lives. Then, we find out why Andrew regrets making all those GitHub actions he did a while ago. There is a discussion about Adam Wathan recently tweeting about GitHub issues, and an idea he had as a follow up tweet. Andrew shares a hot tip if you are leaving an issue, Jason talks about using NextRails, and Chris tells us a story when he had his first Rails job and learning to version your gems. We end with Chris announcing that there could be a potential “Mega Episode” coming up soon!
