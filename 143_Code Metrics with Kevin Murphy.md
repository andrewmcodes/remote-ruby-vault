## Summary

Jason, Chris, and Andrew are all back today and we have a special guest joining us! Today we have joining us, Kevin Murphy, who is the Director of Software Development at the The Gnar Company and he has several RailsConf talks that are really good that you should check out. On this episode, we’re going to be talking about the downsides of focusing on code coverage, drive performance as a singular measure of “good code.” How do we evaluate whether our developers are doing their jobs or not? Kevin dives into code coverage, the downsides of it, and why he loves tests. Also, the guys chat about tools, rules, performance, metrics they like, and using SimpleCov.

## Description

[00:03:15] We start with Andrew telling us he’s not a fan of code coverage metric and talks about a gem everyone uses called SimpleCov and what it does. Kevin dives into code coverage and why he doesn’t believe it’s a holistic measure and how code coverage can lie to you.
[00:05:40] Find out why Kevin love tests, and he explains some other downsides of focusing on code coverage and brings up Coveralls and when is it too much.
[00:08:55] Andrew asks Kevin if there are some metrics that are good to track to provide value for your team.
[00:15:59] Chris and Kevin chat about tools and Andrew mentions Attractor, from Julian Rubisch and possibly RubyCritic.
[00:17:33] Andrew wonders how important is it that your code base is super dry, and Kevin expresses his opinion on this. He mentions Sandi Metz talking about “duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.”
[00:23:24] Andrew and Kevin discuss the topic of “rules” and why Andrew doesn’t like that term for programming things.
[00:25:49] The topic of performance is discussed and how it goes back to what is the business value of it. Kevin talks about the tricky things of performance as well.
[00:32:00] Kevin shares some other things when it comes to measuring “good code.”
[00:33:38] Andrew, Chris, and Jason share the metrics they like, they share examples, and they talk about using SimpleCov.
[00:42:14] Find out where you can follow Kevin online, and if you need a speaker at your next virtual regional meetup, go ahead and reach out to him.
