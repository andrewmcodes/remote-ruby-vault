[00:02:42] Robby tells us about Z shells being the default on macOS and if more people are using it.
[00:04:04] Since Robby’s been in the Rails Community for a long time, he tells us how things have changed and how he got into Ruby on Rails and Z shell.
[00:16:34] Robby tells us about doing something in Postgres, but curious about using DRb (distributed object system for Ruby,) and a story about a past FOSSCON he went to in Portland.
[00:20:59] Jason is curious to know since Robby owns an agency, if the work he takes on is primarily Ruby on Rails work. He mentions not being a maker, but a mender.
[00:28:35] Chris is curious to know from Robby if a new developer comes into a team, how can you address comprehending or understanding things and make it maintainable for the longer term.
[00:34:00] Chris talks about maintaining stuff, learning code, and the reality of working as a developer.
