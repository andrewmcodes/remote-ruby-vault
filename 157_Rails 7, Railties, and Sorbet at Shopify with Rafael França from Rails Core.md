## Summary

We are back from RubyConf and excited to have as our guest, Rafael França, who works at Shopify and here to chat with us about Rails and Ruby things. Today, we learn what brought Rafael into Ruby and then into Rails. We find out more about what happened with the Rails and Merb merge, what a Railtie is, and how the Rails engine builds on top of the Railtie. He also tells us more about his team at Shopify, his thoughts on the state of Rails 7, using Types in Rails, Tapioca, and why Shopify chose Sorbet instead of RBS. Go ahead and download this episode now to find out more!
