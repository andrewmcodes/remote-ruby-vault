## Summary

After discovering StimulusReflex, we knew we had to get Nate Hopkins to join us on the podcast. Nate is working on some very cool things around the StimulusJS library and Rails. When not working on StimulusReflex, Nate is an artist, consultant, and Ruby Rogues panelist. We talked with Nate about the early days of JavaScript up to JavaScript as we know it today, as well as the motivation behind StimulusReflex.
