# Remote Ruby Obsidian Vault

An Obsidian vault filled with Remote Ruby epsides. This was created for research purposes and is not guarenteed to stay a public repo when I no longer need it.

## Getting Started

### With Obsidian

This is an Obsidian vault, so if you have Obsidian installed, you can open the folder as a vault.

Note: install from the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md) or `brew install --cask obsidian`.

1. Clone the project

```bash
  gh repo clone andrewmcodes/remote-ruby-vault
  # or
  git clone https://github.com/andrewmcodes/remote-ruby-vault.git
```

2. In Obsidian, open the folder as a vault.

Note: If you are already in your own vault, click the vault icon in the bottom right to switch and open this new one.

### Without Obsidian

This [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) will allow the backlinks to work properly so you can click through them without needing Obsidian installed. However, the main power of this vault is the extendable dashboard query being used that you won't be able to see without Obsidian.

### Without Cloning

Hit `.` while on the repo page and open with [github.dev](https://github.dev/andrewmcodes/remote-ruby-vault) and just edit the Markdown like normal!
