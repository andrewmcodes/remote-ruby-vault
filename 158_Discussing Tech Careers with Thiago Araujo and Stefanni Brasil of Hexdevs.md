## Summary

This week we are excited to have two guests joining us, Thiago Araujo and Stefanni Brasil, who are the Founders of hexdevs, where they build programs that train developers for excellence, as well as host the hexdevs podcast. We learn more about how Thiago and Stefanni started doing the open source livestreams and what their goals are for them. We have some deep discussions on doing interviews and if it would make a difference in what degree you had, the importance of mentors, and why techs have a bad rep. Steffani and Thiago give us the details on their workshop coming up soon which is giving Andrew good vibes because it sounds amazing!
