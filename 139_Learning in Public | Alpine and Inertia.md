## Summary

Chris is on vacation, so today it’s Jason and Andrew in the house and they are “learning in public.” What does this mean? Listen and find out! Jason’s been trying out Inertia.js so he tells us all about it and what he likes about it. Find out more about a JavaScript package called Headless UI that Tailwind has, and how things started to get really cool when Jason used Pagy and its Metadata mode. Andrew shares something he sees people missing the point about in ViewComponent, and he goes in depth about a great component library from Seek-oss called Braid Design System. The guys discuss their ADHD meds and how it’s helped them both, as well as Andrew explaining how getting an ADHD coach was one of the best things he’s ever done. Also, there is a Ruby announcement, so download this episode now to find out more!

## Description

[00:00:42] Andrew gives us an update if he finished his JavaScript framework he was working on, and he tells us why he chooses to use Alpine over Stimulus.
[00:03:45] Find out about a method that Bridgetown has called jsonify and what it does.
[00:04:55] Jason tells us since he’s been low key back in action this week and he’s been trying out Inertia.js. The creator of Inertia, Jonathan Reinink was on a previous episode that you should listen to. Also, Jason talks about how he likes using Tailwind.
[00:06:06] Learn more about a JavaScript package called Headless UI that Tailwind has and what Inertia does. Andrew brings up an episode of The Bike Shed podcast called “All Things Inertia” that’s worth a listen, where Jonathan explains Inertia, the integrations with Rails, and how and why you would use it with Rails.
[00:08:48] Jason talks about something else that’s appealing to him about Inertia. He also tells us about working with data, making a project model, and how things started to get really cool using Pagy and its Metadata mode.
[00:13:04] Andrew shares something he sees people missing the point about in View Component. He also goes in depth about a great component library from Seek-oss called, “Braid Design System.”
[00:18:58] Jason tells us his struggles with components and how having the React pre-built it’s like a lesson in how to structure things.
[00:22:09] Andrew gives a shout-out to ADHD, our constant friend and protector of all things happy, and goes into having a weird perfectionism around things he built. Jason chimes in and talks about having the same issue. They also talk about their ADHD meds they’re taking and how it’s changed their lives.
[00:27:41] Andrew shares one of the best things he’s ever done for his ADHD, which was getting an ADHD coach he met on Twitter, Dusty Chipura, and how helpful she was.
[00:29:04] We have a Ruby announcement! Check out the article linked below!
