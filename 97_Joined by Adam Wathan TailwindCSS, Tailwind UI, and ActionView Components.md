## Summary

In this episode we welcome back a special guest, Adam Wathan, creator of Tailwind CSS. We find out some cool things that have happened in Tailwind, new things that have launched in Tailwind UI, and issues he ran into when building it. Adam tells us about a work system they use called the six-week cycle with a two-week cool down, which really helps with prioritizing things. We also talk with Adam about how he approaches building components in JavaScript libraries like Vue in an effort to apply some of that wisdom to ViewComponent.

[00:08:09] Jason wonders if Tailwind UI is considered early access.

[00:32:58] Adam tells us what his life is like now during the day since he’s taken on employees, and if he finds himself doing a lot more business work versus open source or Tailwind UI work. He talks about the “six-week cycle with a two-week cool down” that they have been doing at work.
