## Summary

In this episode, Chris, Nate, and Andrew touch on how RailsConf and MicroConf have been cancelled due to the COVID-19. Andrew’s remote meetup is discussed. Also, other topics include Standard RB, Jumpstart Pro, ERB Lint, HTML Beautifier, global.iD, Secrets, and a few others. And to end the episode, a rather funny story from Andrew with something that drove him, “Freakin’ batty!’

## Description

[00:03:41] Andrew talks about his “experiment” which is a remote-like meetup he is putting together.
[00:10:31] There is talk about Standard RB on twitter and Jumpstart Pro being a good place to begin because it’s a template.
[00:16:30] Chris brings up ERB Lint wondering if it’s been handy for the guys. Andrew mentions an HTML Beautifier that works with ERB that runs on that code which is nice.
[00:22:49] Andrew’s FAVORITE question is asked about whether it’s a good idea to run a fixed version of a command rather than track to see if it passes or fails and if there is a downside to that.
[00:29:26] Chris mentions the official github actions set-up for Ruby which is so much faster. Andrew quotes, “There was a bit of contention in the action community.”
[00:32:13] Chris talks about Secrets getting tricky on forks and there wasn’t any solution he could see.
[00:34:55] Nate reveals some cool cache stuff he’s been doing on CodeFund so he gives some information on it.
[00:52:54] Chris brings up the Devise Masquerade gem and how nice it is to have. Which also brings up global.iD and how useful and powerful it is.
[01:02:48] To end the episode, Andrew has a rather funny story about what happened when he added “dark mode” to the rubymeetup.online site.
